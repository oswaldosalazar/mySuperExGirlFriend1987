Once upon a time.
Band Camp.
Summer of 1987.

Eugene plays the flute. (Exceeding well, I might add)
His parents are just so proud of him, but his peers on the other hand...

They called him crabby pants. Because on a fishing trip one time,
the bully of the class dumped a bucket of crabs in his
pants. One crab severed an artery in his left testicle. So they also
call him uni-ball.

Uniball Crabby Pants.

And then there was Shelly. The girl of his dreams.
